# Prework study guide for Bootcamp

## Description

I created this webpage to help retain the information I have learened while completing my modules for my bootcamp. I was motivated to create and finish this study guide because I wanted to organize what I've learned and what I am struggling with. A problem that I helped solve was the ability to find a webpage that contains valuable information for the upcoming UC Davis bootcamp. Now, someone who is entering the bootcamp can review the created study guide. I learned that web development integrates many tools to build a webpage, while learning the basics of html, CSS, and JavaScript
